# After we wrote these programs we learned that in Pandas we could use df = df[df['year']==2018] 
# to remove the lines we didnÂ´t need. But since we already had done it this way we continued with it. 
# This also made it easier to handle CSV files because they became smaller.
# If a row at index 2 doesnt have 2018 we don't rewrite it.
