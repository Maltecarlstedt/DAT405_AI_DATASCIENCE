If you think that the future reward is as important as the current reward you would set this to 0.99999. If you don't care about the future rewards you would set this to 0 and you only care about the current reward.

Running the algorithm with num_episodes = 10000 showed that the value never fell below a certain value. Instead we chose to display some episodes and found that the values seem to stabilize and give us an convergance interval. By only showing the last values in a 1000 or 10000 long episode we could see that the matrices were about the same.
