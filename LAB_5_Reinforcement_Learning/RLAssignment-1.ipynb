If you think that the future reward is as important as the current reward you would set this to 0.99999. If you don't care about the future rewards you would set this to 0 and you only care about the current reward.

    "When running the algorithm no convergance value seemed to be found. We tried comparing the difference between each value in every state to see if it ever fell below a certain constant. Running the algorithm with num_episodes = 10000 showed that the value never fell below a certain value. Instead we chose to display some episodes and found that the values seem to stabilize and give us an convergance interval. By only showing the last values in a 1000 or 10000 long episode we could see that the matrices were about the same. Giving us the conclusion that we have a convergance interval between ~50 to ~70. This can be seen in the txt file: RLAssignment-output-q3.txt. Where we have printed the first 10 values and the last 10 values. The 10000th episode looks like: \n",

For an example if we were studying mice following a maze where in each turn the mouse can either go left or right. The mice will probably choose the path in which there is a piece of cheese laying (the reward). However what if that is the only piece of cheese there is going further along that path? If instead we could program mice to sometimes (say maybe 10% exploration) take the other path. Along this path there are several more rewards layin along the trail. If the mouse wasn't programmed to sometimes explore a little, the mouse would probably always take the path which immediatly gives an reward. After some time the mouse would (hopefully) learn to take the other path since it's more rewarding in the long run.  "

    "The k-armed bandit problem comes initially from a gambler who tries do decide which slot machine to play on (armed bandits). The problem entails the trade off between exploration and exploitaition. In this problem the gambler has to choose which slot machine to play on. Each slot machine has a probability of giving a reward (getting 3 in a row). The gambler then has to decide wheter to keep playing on the machine his already playing on (exploitaition) or to use another machine (exploration) to be able to maximise his profits. This tradeoff has to be calculated since the gambler wants to maximise his profits, exploring a new machine could end in a loss but also gives new knowledge in regards to this new machine and the machines hes already played. By using his prior knowledge and adding in exploration the gambler wants to calculate the perfect tradeoff between exploitation and exploration; which machines to play and how many times he should pull the lever on the armed bandit."
